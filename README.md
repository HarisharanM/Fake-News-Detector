# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real**. It’s built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, with data sourced from the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).
